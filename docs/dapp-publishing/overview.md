# Publishing to the Solana dApp Store

## Overview

Publishing a dApp to the Solana dApp Store involves the following:

1. Create a set of NFTs describing the dApp, publisher, and release on-chain.
1. Submit a request to the Solana dApp Store publisher portal requesting that Solana Mobile team review the dApp's release NFT.

The publishing tool is designed for CI/CD usage - all steps, including submitting publish portal requests, can be integrated into your dApp release workflows. All files used during the NFT creation and publishing request submission steps can be committed to source control.
