# Submit your dApp release

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

After minting a Publisher and App NFT, you will need to mint a **Release NFT** in order to submit for app review.

A Release NFT:

- Contains metadata that represents a specific release version of an app.
- Should be newly created each time an updated app version is submitted.

For reference, you can view this [sample](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EpYpJpFSKX6r5WyAGjhVk2hN8weeJF9XGJHFMvebBW8Q/metadata) of a Release NFT on the Solana Explorer.

## Mint a release NFT

Using the same wallet that contains your Publisher and App NFTs, run this command to create the Release NFT and upload your app's Android APK.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Arweave" label="Arweave">

By default the CLI uploads both the Android APK and NFT metadata using [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

```shell
npx dapp-store create release -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Amazon S3" label="Amazon S3">

Alternatively, you can instruct the CLI to upload both the Android APK and NFT metadata using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), by passing in
the `-s` or `--storage-config` flag.

```shell
npx dapp-store create release -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools> -s <s3_params> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
```

The `<s3_params>` is are an array of parameters in the expected format:

```
s3Params="[\"s3\", \"$releaseAwsAccessKey\", \"$releaseAwsSecretKey\", \"$releaseAwsS3Bucket\", \"$releaseAwsS3Region\"]"
```

An example of S3 parameters:

```shell
-s "[\"s3\", \"TestAccessKey\", \"TestSecret\", \"TestBucket\", \"us-east-1\"]"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**You will repeat this step for each new version of your dApp you want to release**. The mint address of the latest release is recorded in your configuration file.

:::tip
When using CLI version >= `0.8.0`, the following commands will submit a Solana transaction that includes a default priority fee of `500000` lamports.

To customize this value, use param `-p` or `--priority-fee-lamports <priority-fee-lamports>`
:::

:::caution
Please make sure your network connection is reliable and has a minimum upload speed of 0.25 megabytes per second.

## Submit your app

After minting a complete set of on-chain NFTs (publisher, dApp, and release), you may choose to submit them to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal, as a candidate for inclusion in the Solana dApp Store catalog.

```shell
npx dapp-store publish submit -k <path_to_your_keypair> -u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url> --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
```

The two flags for this command (`--requestor-is-authorized` and `--complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies`) are attestations from the requestor that this dApp is compliant with Solana dApp Store policies, and that they are authorized to submit this request to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal.
