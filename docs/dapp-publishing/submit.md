# Submit your dApp release

After minting an App NFT, you will need to mint a **Release NFT** in order to submit for app review.

A Release NFT:

- Contains metadata that represents a specific release version of an app.
- Should be newly created each time an updated app version is submitted.

## Mint a release NFT

Using the same wallet that contains your App NFT, run this command.

```shell
npx dapp-store create release -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
```

**You will repeat this step for each new version of your dApp you want to release**. The mint address of the latest release is recorded in your configuration file.

:::tip
When using CLI version >= `0.8.0`, the following commands will submit a Solana transaction that includes a default priority fee of `500000` lamports.

To customize this value, use param `-p` or `--priority-fee-lamports <priority-fee-lamports>`

:::caution
Please make sure your network connection is reliable and has a minimum upload speed of 0.25 megabytes per second.

## Submit your app

After minting a complete set of on-chain NFTs (App NFT and Release NFT), you may choose to submit them to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal, as a candidate for inclusion in the Solana dApp Store catalog:

```shell
npx dapp-store publish submit -k <path_to_your_keypair> -u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url> --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
```

The two flags for this command (`--requestor-is-authorized` and `--complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies`) are attestations from the requestor that this dApp is compliant with Solana dApp Store policies, and that they are authorized to submit this request to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal.
