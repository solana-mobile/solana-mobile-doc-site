# Welcome publishers!

Weâ€™re glad youâ€™re ready to learn about publishing your Web3 apps on the Solana dApp Store, the fee-free app store for the [Saga](https://solanamobile.com/saga) device.

What do we mean by fee-free? We mean that no fees are collected by Solana Mobile Inc. from users of the dApp Store. There may still be network transaction fees or app-specific fees associated with usage of the Solana dApp Store, or of apps installed by it. None of these fees are collected by, or on behalf of, Solana Mobile Inc.

# Why publish on the Solana dApp Store?

The Solana dApp Store is an app store for the Saga, a flagship Android phone from Solana Mobile designed for Web3. Saga also includes Seed Vault, a key custody solution for the Solana network. The Solana dApp Store offers the attention of engaged Web3-focused users of the Saga device, combined with [publisher policies](./policy) compatible with crypto use-cases, such as NFTs, DeFi, payments, blockchain gaming, and more.

# How is the Solana dApp Store different?

## Friendly home for Web3 content

The Solana dApp Store welcomes Web3 content. Apps are allowed to let users buy, sell, and trade digital goods, participate in DeFi, token-gate experiences based on the contents of a usersâ€™ wallets, send and receive microtransactions, use the payment system of its choice, etc, freely, without policies preventing these uses, or requiring a portion of revenue be remitted to the app store.

## Fee-free

Solana Mobile Inc. does not collect any fees in-app purchases, app purchases, or subscriptions, nor are any fees collected on its behalf by apps in the catalog.

## Publishing vs. curation

With the Solana dApp Store, apps are published on-chain, represented by NFTs (representing the publisher, the app, and each release). These NFTs belong to the publisher who minted them - ownership of the private key for the minting account grants the right to publish new versions of that app. These NFTs describe each release of an app, and contain everything necessary to display the details of that app to users.

Once minted, an app publisher may submit the details of their app NFT to the Solana dApp publisher portal, for inclusion in the catalog. This catalog is curated by Solana Mobile Inc., based on our [publisher policies](./policy).

# What is the process of publishing my app on the Solana dApp Store?

For technical details, please see our [publishing walkthrough guide](./publishing), but at a high level, the process is the following:

1. Prepare your app for release. Make sure it complies with the Solana dApp Store [publisher policies](./policy).
2. Fill in a configuration file, describing your app as you want it to appear in the Solana dApp Store catalog
3. Mint NFTs representing the publisher (i.e. you!), the app, and details of the specific release or version you are submitting to the dApp Store
4. Submit a publisher portal request for your new (or updated) release
5. Wait for a response. Watch your emails; we may have questions for you about your app.
6. Ta-da ðŸŽ‰. Your app is now listed in the Solana dApp Store catalog.


# Getting started

## 1. Read the publisher policies

Weâ€™ve created the Solana dApp Store to be the best home for Web3 and crypto apps. Our [policies](./policy) exist to protect users from illegal, harmful, and misleading content, without restricting the abilities of apps to use crypto features, like trading NFTs or other digital goods.

All apps submitted to the Solana dApp Store must comply with these policies. If you have concerns about an app in the Solana dApp Store catalog, please report it to [concerns@dappstore.solanamobile.com](mailto:concerns@dappstore.solanamobile.com).

## 2. Read the Solana dApp Store Developer Agreement

Make sure to read and understand the Solana dApp Store Developer Agreement, linked in the navigation. These terms apply to all submissions made to the Solana dApp Store publisher portal.

## 3. Publish

Publishing your app to the Solana dApp Store involves two steps - minting NFTs representing your app on-chain, and submitting a request to the publisher portal to have your app listed in the catalog.

Check out the [publishing walkthrough guide](./publishing) for step-by-step instructions on how to mint an appâ€™s NFTs and submit publisher portal requests.

## 4. Wait for a decision on your app

After submitting, weâ€™ll review your app against our [policies](./policy). Please make sure to provide a valid email address, so that we can reach out to you with any questions about your submission.
