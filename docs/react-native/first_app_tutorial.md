title: Your first React Native dApp
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a React Native dApp that sends a message to the Solana network.

## What you will learn
- How to use [**Mobile Wallet Adapter**](/getting-started/overview#mobile-wallet-adapter) to connect to an installed wallet app.
- How to connect to devnet, check your wallet balance, and request an airdrop of SOL.
- How to use the memo program to write your message to the network
- View your message on the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)!

## Prerequisites
Read the [prerequisite setup](../getting-started/development-setup) guide before starting the tutorial. 
You'll need:
- a running Android emulator or device to build and launch your app.
- an MWA-compatible wallet installed on the same device.
- an IDE/Editor of your choice.


This tutorial will be using the [fakewallet](../getting-started/development-setup#3-install-a-wallet-app) app to test your app's integration with Mobile Wallet Adapter.


## Clone the React Native dApp Scaffold

This dApp will build off the **[React Native Scaffold dApp](/react-native/setup#solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold)** which already has a simple user interface that allows you to connect to a mobile wallet, request an airdrop, and sign transactions. 

#### Step 1. Initialize a template app

```shell
npx react-native init FirstDappTutorial --template https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold.git
```

#### Step 2. Enter the directory and install the project dependencies.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```shell
cd FirstDappTutorial && yarn install 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell
cd FirstDappTutorial && npm install 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Step 3. Make sure your emulator/device is running, then build and launch the app.

```shell
npx react-native run-android
```

### First run

At this point, your app should build, install into your device, and launch automatically. 
You should also see the Metro Bundler console window pop up. This is where you can read the logs and access the debug menu.

With React Native's *fast refresh* feature, you can edit the React components, save your changes, and immediately see your app UI update!

## Scaffold dApp Components

Now lets quickly go over the features of the dApp Scaffold. If you want to skip to building the memo transaction, then jump to this [section](/react-native/first_app_tutorial#send-a-memo-transaction).

### Connect Button
Clicking on the *Connect Wallet* button will 'connect' you to a locally installed MWA-compatible wallet. It uses the Mobile Wallet Adapter 
SDK to request [`authorization`](/react-native/quickstart#authorizing-a-wallet) from the wallet and receives your wallet account's info, like the public key.

On click, it starts a wallet session with `transact` and calls `authorizeSession` from the `AuthorizationProvider` class.
```tsx
await transact(async wallet => {
    await authorizeSession(wallet);
});
```

`AuthorizationProvider` is a helper class that manages wallet authorization. It calls `wallet.authorize()` on first connect, and for subsequent connects it re-uses
the `authToken` in `wallet.reauthorize()`.

```tsx
const authorizeSession = useCallback(
    async (wallet: AuthorizeAPI & ReauthorizeAPI) => {
        const authorizationResult = await (authorization
        ? wallet.reauthorize({
            auth_token: authorization.authToken,
            identity: APP_IDENTITY,
            })
        : wallet.authorize({
            cluster: APP_CLUSTER,
            identity: APP_IDENTITY,
            }));
        console.log(authorizationResult);
        return (await handleAuthorizationResult(authorizationResult))
        .selectedAccount;
    },
    [authorization, handleAuthorizationResult],
);
```

### Account Info

This is a simple component takes a balance in [*lamports*](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#lamport) and converts it to units of [*SOL*](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#sol) for display. 

#### Balance fetching
In the `MainScreen.tsx` component, we fetch the user's wallet balance when its available, and pass it into the `AccountInfo` component.
To do so, we use the `connection` class and just call the `getBalance` function, which is part of the [API spec](https://docs.solana.com/api/http#getbalance).

```tsx
const {connection} = useConnection();
const fetchAndUpdateBalance = useCallback(
    async (account: Account) => {
        const fetchedBalance = await connection.getBalance(account.publicKey);
        setBalance(fetchedBalance);
    },
    [connection],
);
```

### Airdrop Button

This component takes in a user's wallet `publicKey` and requests an airdrop of lamports to that address on click. Again, we use the `connection` class
and call the `requestAirdrop` RPC method, as part of the [API spec](https://docs.solana.com/api/http#requestairdrop).

```tsx
const requestAirdrop = useCallback(async () => {
    const signature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
        selectedAccount.publicKey,
        LAMPORTS_PER_AIRDROP,
    );
    return await connection.confirmTransaction(signature);
}, [connection, selectedAccount]);
```

### Sign Transaction/Message Button

The `SignMessageButton` component takes in a `messageBuffer` byte array and calls `wallet.signMessages()`. This requests the
connected wallet to sign the message with the user's private key.

The `SignTransactionButton` component does several things on click. Within the wallet session, it constructs a `Transaction` with a
`SystemProgram.transfer` instruction, then requests the wallet to provide a signature in the transaction.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Sign Message" label="Sign Message">

```tsx
const signMessage = useCallback(
    async (messageBuffer: Uint8Array) => {
        return await transact(async (wallet: Web3MobileWallet) => {
        // First, request for authorization from the wallet.
        const authorizationResult = await authorizeSession(wallet);

        // Sign the payload with the provided address from authorization.
        const signedMessages = await wallet.signMessages({
            addresses: [authorizationResult.address],
            payloads: [messageBuffer],
        });

        return signedMessages[0];
        });
    },
    [authorizeSession],
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sign Transaction" label="Sign Transaction">

```tsx
const signTransaction = useCallback(async () => {
    return await transact(async (wallet: Web3MobileWallet) => {
        const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'), 'confirmed');

        // First, request for authorization from the wallet and fetch the latest
        // blockhash for building the transaction.
        const [authorizationResult, latestBlockhash] = await Promise.all([
            authorizeSession(wallet),
            connection.getLatestBlockhash(),
        ]);

        // Construct a transaction. This transaction uses web3.js `SystemProgram`
        // to create a transfer that sends lamports to randomly generated address.
        const keypair = Keypair.generate();
        const randomTransferTransaction = new Transaction({
            ...latestBlockhash,
            feePayer: authorizationResult.publicKey,
        }).add(
        SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: authorizationResult.publicKey,
            toPubkey: keypair.publicKey,
            lamports: 1_000,
        }),
        );

        // Sign a transaction and receive
        const signedTransactions = await wallet.signTransactions({
            transactions: [randomTransferTransaction],
        });

        return signedTransactions[0];
    }, [authorizeSession]);
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Send a memo transaction

Now that we've gone over the existing scaffold, lets add some new functionality to it. 

Instead of a random transfer transaction, lets create a new transaction that records an immutable message on the Solana blockchain, 
using the [Memo program](https://spl.solana.com/memo). After that, we can view our message on the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/).

### Copy over the SignTransactionButton

Lets build off our existing `SignTransactionButton`, and copy it over into a new component renamed to `SendMemoButton`. Then, rename the `signTransaction` helper function into `sendMemo`.


### Construct a memo program transaction

First, let's replace the existing `randomTransferTransaction` with a new transaction that calls the Solana `Memo` program address. Within the `transact` block, 
add this code and remove `randomTransferTransaction`.

```tsx
import {TextEncoder} from 'text-encoding'; // TextEncoder library to convert stirng to buffer.

// Construct a message buffer from a string.
const message = "Hello Solana!";
const messageBuffer = new TextEncoder().encode(message) as Buffer

// Construct a 'Hello World' transaction and replace `randomTransferTransaction
const memoProgramTransaction = new Transaction({
    ...latestBlockhash,
    feePayer: authorizationResult.publicKey,
}).add(
    new TransactionInstruction({
    data: messageBuffer,
    keys: [],
    programId: new PublicKey(
        'MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr', // Memo Program address
    ),
    }),
);
```

### Request the wallet to sign and send a transaction

Next, instead of `wallet.signTransactions()`, now lets request our wallet to send the transaction for us, with `wallet.signAndSendTransactions()`. 

This is an optional feature that MWA wallets can choose to support, and `fakewallet` does support this. You can also directly use `connection`
to [send and confirm a transaction](https://solanacookbook.com/references/basic-transactions.html#how-to-send-sol).

```tsx
// Changed to `signAndSendTransactions.` and pass in `memoProgramTransaction`.
const transactionSignatures = await wallet.signAndSendTransactions({
    transactions: [memoProgramTransaction],
});
```

### Confirm the transaction

Now, the last step is to confirm that the transaction was processed by the network. Add this to the send
of the `transact` session and return the both `[signature, confirmationRepsonse]`. Read the docs learn more about [transaction confirmation](https://docs.solana.com/developing/transaction_confirmation).

```tsx
// Add this step to confirm that the transaction was proccessed by the network.
const confirmationResponse = await connection.confirmTransaction({
    signature: signature,
    ...latestBlockhash,
});

return [signature, confirmationResponse];
```

### Add Solana Explorer link navigation

After transaction confirmation, we can now view the message on the Solana blockchain itself! To do so,
we'll use the public tool [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/), construct an explorer URL, and prompt the user to
navigate to the link through an alert.

```tsx
// Show an alert with an explorer link when we have a confirmed memo transaction.
function showExplorerAlert(memoTransactionSignature: string, cluster: string) {
  const explorerUrl =
    'https://explorer.solana.com/tx/' +
    memoTransactionSignature +
    '?cluster=' +
    cluster;
  Alert.alert(
    'Success!',
    'Your message was successfully recorded. View your message on Solana Explorer:',
    [
      {text: 'View', onPress: () => Linking.openURL(explorerUrl)},
      {text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel'},
    ],
  );
}
```


### Update the button onPress

Almost done! Now just update the `onPress` handler in the button component to call `sendMemo`, handle errors, and show the explorer URL.
Here is what the final code should look like at this step for `sendMemo` and the button component.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="SendMemoButton" label="SendMemoButton">

```tsx
return (
    <Button
        title="Send Memo!"
        disabled={signingInProgress}
        onPress={async () => {
            if (signingInProgress) {
                return;
            }
            setSigningInProgress(true);
            try {
                const [memoTransactionSignature, confirmationResponse] = await sendMemo();
                const err = confirmationResponse.value.err;
                if (err) {
                console.log(
                    'Failed to record message:' +
                    (err instanceof Error ? err.message : err),
                );
                } else {
                    // APP_CLUSTER is either 'devnet', 'testnet', 'mainnet-beta'.
                    showExplorerAlert(memoTransactionSignature, APP_CLUSTER);
                }
            } finally {
                setSigningInProgress(false);
            }
        }}
    />
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sendMemo" label="sendMemo">

```tsx
const sendMemo = useCallback(
    async (
        messageBuffer: Buffer,
    ): Promise<[string, RpcResponseAndContext<SignatureResult>]> => {
        const latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
        const signature = await transact(async (wallet: Web3MobileWallet) => {
        const authorizationResult = await authorizeSession(wallet);

        const memoProgramTransaction = new Transaction({
            ...latestBlockhash,
            feePayer: authorizationResult.publicKey,
        }).add(
            new TransactionInstruction({
            data: messageBuffer,
            keys: [],
            programId: new PublicKey(
                'MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr', // Memo Program address
            ),
            }),
        );

        const transactionSignatures = await wallet.signAndSendTransactions({
            transactions: [memoProgramTransaction],
        });
            return transactionSignatures[0];
        });

        // Add this step to confirm that the transaction was proccessed by the network.
        const confirmationResponse = await connection.confirmTransaction({
            signature: signature,
            ...latestBlockhash,
        });

        return [signature, confirmationResponse];
    },
    [authorizeSession, connection],
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finishing touches

Last step. All that's left is to render the new `SendMemoButton` in the app's `MainScreen`. Just change the existing `SignTransactionButton` 
component into the `SendMemoButton` component and you're done!

Make sure you request an airdrop of SOL before pressing the `SendMemoButton`, as 
you need to pay a small fee to send transactions on the network.

**Congratulations!**

You've finished the tutorial and built your first mobile dApp! Play around with the new `SendMemoButton` and view your message on the explorer. Make sure, you request 
an airdrop of SOL before trying to send the transaction.
